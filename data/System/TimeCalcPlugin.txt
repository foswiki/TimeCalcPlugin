%$SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Description

This plugin enables various calculations of time and dates that you will often need in a business environment.

Some of the features are

   * Calculate working/business days between two dates
   * Add/subtract a number of working/business days to/from a given date
   * Display a time in any format
   * Store and use special !TimeCalcPlugin storage variables so a macro can use the result of an earlier used macro

---++ Syntax Rules

%INCLUDE{"VarWORKINGDAYS"}%

%INCLUDE{"VarADDWORKINGDAYS"}%

%INCLUDE{"VarTIMESHOWSTORE"}%

---++ Time Format Tokens

For macros where a time format can be specified the following tokens are used

| *Token:* | *Unit:* | *Example* |
| =$seconds= | seconds | 59 |
| =$minutes= | minutes | 59 |
| =$hours= | hours | 23 |
| =$day= | day of month | 31 |
| =$wday= | day of the Week (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat) | Thu |
| =$dow= | day of the week (Sun = 0) | 2  |
| =$week= | number of week in year (ISO 8601) | 34 |
| =$month= | short name of month | Dec |
| =$mo= | 2 digit month | 12 |
| =$year= | 4 digit year | 1999 |
| =$ye= | 2 digit year | 99 |
| =$tz= | either "GMT" (if set to gmtime), or "Local" (if set to servertime) | GMT |
| =$iso= | ISO format timestamp | %GMTIME{"$iso"}% |
| =$rcs= | RCS format timestamp | %GMTIME{"$rcs"}% |
| =$http= | E-mail & http format timestamp | %GMTIME{"$http"}% |
| =$epoch= | Number of seconds since 00:00 on 1st January, 1970 | %GMTIME{"$epoch"}% |

Tokens can be shortened to 3 characters

---++ Storage Macros

Most of the macros in this plugin can store variables that represents a time. These variables can be used later in another macro as an input.

Storage variables names can only be A-Z, a-z,0-9, and _.

A macro can only use a variable as input if it has been defined earlier in the topic. Macros are expanded from top to bottom, from left to right, from inside and out.
If you try to use a variable that has not been defined, it is set to the current time.

Times that the result of adding working days are always stored as the date with time set to 12:00 GMT.
Times given as inputs for the working day macros are converted to the same day at 12:00 GMT. Holidays are also converted to 12:00 GMT.

The storage feature can be used to create a chain of dates, for example a schedule in a table, where first date is defined using TIMESHOWSTORE, and the following dates are autocalculated by adding working days with ADDWORKINGDAYS

---++ Holiday lists

List of holidays has to given as comma separated dates. You cannot specify an interval. You can have duplicate dates. The duplicates are ignored.
This means that you can define macros for public holidays of multiple countries, and a personal calendar with your vacation days and merge them even though they may contain duplicate dates.

You merge them like this: holidays="%<nop>HOLIDAYS%,%<nop>MYVACATIONDAYS%"

   * %<nop>ADDWORKINGDAYS{date="23 Nov 2010" delta="20" holidays="24 Dec 2010, 25 Dec 2010, 26 Dec 2010" store="builddate"}%
      * Returns (value if installed is 21 Dec 2010) %ADDWORKINGDAYS{date="23 Nov 2010" delta="20" holidays="24 Dec 2010, 25 Dec 2010, 01 Jan 2011" store="builddate"}%
